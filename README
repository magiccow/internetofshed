Python code for Raspberry Pi Zero (under Raspian) to read several sensors:

- DS18b20 for temperature
- DHT11 for temperature / humidity
- 2 x switches (door & window position)
- LDR for light sensing (via PCF 8591 4-channel I2C A2D converter)

Data is stored in a sqlite database (for 7 days) and also uploaded to ThingSpeak
